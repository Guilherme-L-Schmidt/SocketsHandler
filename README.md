# SocketsHandler

Communication library using unix sockets, providing data transmission between clients through a server.

The library is contained within the `sockets.cpp` and `sockets.hpp` files, while the `main_daemon.cpp` and `client.cpp` files are an example application. Open `main_daemon.cpp` first, followed by the `clients`, leaving `client1` for last.
